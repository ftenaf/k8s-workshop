The main project for this workshop.

# Synopsis

This is a hands-on workshop, performed on `Ms Azure` and documented into this very same `Github` repository.  
Every command is performed from a Docker container that is our work environement so nothing is required but:

- a browser
- a docker runtime (Docker-Desktop)
- and an `Azure` account able to provision resources on `Azure`.

First, we detail how to set-up this working environment within a `Docker` image.
How to build it and run it interactively.  

Second, we provision a `Kubernetes` _cluster_ in `AKS`.  
Then, we have a scenario on 3 tracks:

Here is a sequence diagram of what we will do:

```

A **1st track** is a dev that builds a simple application.

The whole thing is to build the _CI/CD_ automation to perform these several steps in term of:

- building the app
- packaging it as a `Docker` image
- publishing it into a _container registry_
- packaging an `Helm` chart
- publishing it into a _chart repository_
- deploying it in a `Kubernetes` _namespace_
- testing it
- _promoting_ it for **Prod** deployment

A **2nd track** is another dev performing the same steps but with another application and deploying it into another `Kubernetes` _namespace_.  

A **3rd track** is a _platform ops_ that operates the `Kubernetes` _cluster_.

- How he manages the _Flux_ configuration and orchestration
- He has to upgrade the the database engine, _(yet to come)_
- to upgrade the _cluster_, _(yet to come)_
- to manage the monitoring and alerting systems in order to run the **Prod** smoothly. _(yet to come)_

By doing so, we will be able to show how different teams may work together onto the same `Kubernetes` _clusters_ and the amount of coordination that is needed (or not).

All the automation relies on `Azure DevOps` and `Flux v2`.

# Why 3 tracks?

What I mean by "3 tracks" is that we'll be able to do the following:

- demonstrate each track one after the other
- let attendees choose one track or another, practice on it
- let attendees team up to synchronize with each others in order to complete the whole 3 tracks.


Hope you will enjoy this workshop!ðŸ™‚
